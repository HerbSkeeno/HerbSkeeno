- 👋 Hi, I’m @HerbSkeeno.
- 👀 At the moment I'm trying to wrap my head around the foundational aspects of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking CS50, and teaching myself C++ as I go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other beginners to grow with, and also more experienced folks that would be interested in reaching down to help a young fellow out.
- 📫 You can reach me at hmsneed@gmail.com.
